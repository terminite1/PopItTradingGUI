## The peak of P.I.T exploiting.

This is one of the best Pop It Trading GUIs that is out there. And most importantly, it's easy to use!

The GUI uses the very slate and smooth Orion library which you may find [here](https://github.com/shlexware/Orion).

Now, you may be wondering...

### How does it work?

The terminite P.I.T GUI utilizes the function of the many RemoteEvents found in P.I.T and basic LuaU functions.

### How do I use it?

You may use this GUI with one of many executors, such as [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to) (Paid) or [KRNL](https://krnl.place) (Free).

### Am I being logged? Such as IP or...

Nope! Nothing is being logged. You may check via an HttpSpy that nothing is being logged.

### What are the fundamental features of this GUI?

The most important features that make this GUI worth it are the anti-reap functions! Utilizing my recently discovered method, you will never be reaped as long as you don't equip any items!

### What makes this better than your old GUI?

There are various things. Such as:
```markdown
# 1. Better code
```
My coding back then was pretty wacky and overall, pretty bad. However since then I have attempted improving which turned out pretty successful.

```markdown
# 2. Orion (MAJOR)
```
The old GUI used Kavo's UI Library which I did like however looked pretty bland. I was looking through a UI Thread which linked Orion and my eyes locked on it. It looked beautiful!

### What are all the current features?

As of now (BETA), it contains:
```markdown
# - Quick-Buying
# - Loop-Buying
# - Selling
# - [COMING SOON] Multi-Selling
# - Quick-Dropping
# - Multi-Dropping
# - Reaping functions
# - Anti-Reaping functions
# - Other reaping functions
# - Voiding Items (Selling without gaining money)
# - Miscellaneous
# - Other
```

# So, how do I get it?

Unfortunately, it has not yet released. However, I am actively working on it and planning to release it soon!
